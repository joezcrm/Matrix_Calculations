# Matrix_Operations
System of Linear Equations, Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors, Singular Values Decompose, Least Square

## Purpose
This project is to implement certain matrix operations of **dense matrices**,  (Dense matrices are the matrices that have very limited number of zero elements.) including solving system of linear equations, finding the Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of a matrix, solving least square problems, and performing singular values decompose.  Matrices of the implementation are represented by 2D long double array and it should be sufficient for matrices with sizes less than 10,000.  If sizes of matrices are large, matrix elements should be stored in multiple machines and the implementation of the metioned operations should be modified accordingly.
